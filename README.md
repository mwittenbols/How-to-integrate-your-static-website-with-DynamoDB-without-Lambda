# How to integrate your static website with DynamoDB (without using Lambda) for the Enterprise

In this lab we will show you how you can communicate directly with a DynamoDB back-end from client-side script in your static hosted website.

## Audience

The audience for this lab are system and software engineers with basic knowledge of:

- **AWS**
- **JavaScript**
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/ "cURL") or [https://www.getpostman.com/](https://www.getpostman.com/ "Postman") to test the API endpoints that you are about to create in API gateway

## Executive Summary

API gateway can directly communicate with AWS services using their low-level APIs. This includes AWS services such as DynamoDB and S3. In this lab we show how to directly communicate with DynamoDB through API Gateway without using any server-side logic such as Lambda.

## Prerequisites 

- an active AWS account with a role that has permissions to create endpoints in **API Gateway**.
- [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/ "cURL") installed or [https://www.getpostman.com/](https://www.getpostman.com/ "Postman") opened.
- An existing AWS Service Proxy Execution Role with permissions to read objects from DynamoDB: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-aws-proxy.html#getting-started-aws-proxy-add-roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-aws-proxy.html#getting-started-aws-proxy-add-roles)

## Technical Concepts

### API-first development

**API-first development** is a strategy in which the first order of business is to develop an API that puts your target developerâ€™s interests first and then build the product on top of it (be it a website, mobile application, or a SaaS software). 

By building on top of APIs with developers in mind, you and your developers are saving a lot of work while laying down the foundations for others to build on.

### Static website hosting

The trend of hosting **static websites** in the cloud is a becoming very popular. This approach has been adopted by many organizations due to its advantages over traditional server-based hosting. Static websites are websites that do not require any runtime environment like JRE, .NET, etc. and are mostly based on HTML, CSS, JS, and other static resources (audio/video files, documents, etc.) and using asynchronous HTTP calls to communicate with a back-end API. 
  
You *can* host a static website on **Amazon S3**. On a static website, individual webpages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, a dynamic website relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET. Amazon S3 does not support server-side scripting. With static web-hosting it is relatively easy to port your application to mobile form factors using the same code base. 

However, **since S3 bucket URLs are non-SSL** (in other words: ``http://`` instead of ``https://``) and intended for internet-facing applications, they are **not suitable** to be used **for hosting private enterprise applications**. Even with the integration with a **CloudFront** instance, which would allow associating a SSL certificate to the S3 bucket, the application would still be publicly facing the internet. Therefore, it is our recommendation to **avoid S3 static website hosting** for internal facing enterprise applications and opt for the hosting of a **static website using AWS Elastic Beanstalk** as described in this lab.

### Securing your static hosted website

It is important to realize that in a static hosted API-first architecture all UI script is running in the browser and our true **first line of defense is the server-side API**. Since we are building a static hosted website with an API-first development strategy, your client-side script effectively becomes "open source" and all API-calls should require an access token. This is different from, for example a .NET application, where your UI logic partly runs on the server. 

**Note:** technically we could use an access token to secure all but a single landing page in our static web application. I will go into more depth on this in a later lab.

## Step 1. Create a table in DynamoDB

First, let's create a dummy table in DynamoDB from which we will retrieve some data later on in this lab.

Navigate to the DynamoDB console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home) in the region of your choice, for instance ``us-west-2``.

![](img/DynamoDBCreateTableAnon.png)

Then, click **Create Table**

Then, provide a **Table name**, such as ``StaticHostingSample`` and enter ``Id`` as **Primary Key** for your DynamoDB table:

![](img/DynamoDBCreateTable2Anon.png)

Then, your DynamoDB table will be created:

![](img/DynamoDBTableCreatingAnon.png)

## Step 2. Create item in a DynamoDB table

Then, after your table is created, click on **Items**:

![](img/DynamoDBCreateItemAnon.png)

Then, click **Create Item**. A popup will appear where you can provide data to add to the DynamoDB table:

![](img/DynamoDBCreateItemSelectTextAnon.png)

Now, select **Text** from the drop down list to be able to add a JSON document to the DynamoDB table:

Then, paste the following dummy JSON document generated with [https://www.json-generator.com/](https://www.json-generator.com/) into the text editor and click **Save**:
		
  {
    "Id": "5d1cf7f9c8a7237ccecbaf55",
    "Name": "Leblanc Mckee"
  }

![](img/DynamoDBCreateItemSaveAnon.png)

![](img/DynamoDBItemAnon.png)

Now, we have a dummy record in our DynamoDB table. Let's go ahead and create an API in API Gateway that retrieves data from this DynamoDB table.

## Step 2. Create an API in API Gateway 

First, navigate to the API Gateway console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home) in the region of your choice, for instance ``us-west-2``.

Then, click **Create API**

![](img/CreateAPIAnon.png)

Make sure **REST** and **New API** are selected. Then, enter a name as **API name**, for instance ``StaticHostingSample``, and a **Description**.

Make sure **Endpoint Type** is set to **Regional** as well. 

![](img/CreateAPI2Anon.png)

Then, click **Create API**   

Next, you will see an empty API:

![](img/EmptyAPIAnon.png)


### Step 3. Create a Resource in API Gateway

Then, click **Create Resource** in the **Actions** drop down list 

![](img/CreateResourceAnon.png)

Then, entered ``getDatabaseItem`` as **Resource Name** and make sure you check the checkbox next to **Enable API Gateway CORS** and click **Create Resource**.

![](img/CreateChildResourceAnon.png)

Now you have an empty ``/getDatabaseItem`` resource in your API:

![](img/EmptyChildResourceAnon.png)

Now, let's add a **Method** such as ``GET``:

### Step 4. Create a Method in API Gateway

Make sure you select ``/getdatabaseitem`` if it wasn't already selected and click **Create Method**:

![](img/CreateMethodAnon.png)

Then, a small drop down list will appear. Select **GET** from the drop down list:

![](img/SelectMethodAnon.png)

Then, click the small check icon to confirm the creation of the ``GET`` method:

![](img/ConfirmSelectedMethodAnon.png)

Now, you will land on a page where you can set up the ``GET`` method.

![](img/SetupMethodAnon.png)

### Step 5. Setup Method in API Gateway

Then, select **AWS Service**.

Then, select the desired region from the **Region** drop down list, such as ``us-west-2``.

Select **DynamoDB** from the **AWS Service** drop down list.

Select ``POST`` from the **HTTP method** drop down list.

Make sure **Use action name** is selected as **Action Type**.

Then as **Action** type ``Scan``. This is the low level DynamoDB API endpoint to retrieve all items from a DynamoDB table.

Then as **Execution Role** use ``arn:aws:iam::359158632008:role/APIGatewayAWSProxyExecRole``. This is an Execution Role that has been provided by us for low-level API access to DynamoDB and S3 from API Gateway.

Make sure **Passthrough** is selected from the **Content Handling** drop down list.

Finally, click **Save**

### Step 6. Configure Integration Request

Then, click **Integration Request**

![](img/SelectIntegrationRequestAnon.png)

Then, scroll all the way down to **Mapping Templates** and then click **Add mapping template**:

![](img/AddMappingTemplateAnon.png)

Then, enter ``application/json`` as **Content-Type** and click the little check icon to the right of it.

![](img/MappingTemplateEnterContentTypeAnon.png)

Now, a popup may appear warning you about the consequences of passthrough behavior:

![](img/ChangePassthroughBehaviorPopupAnon.png)

For now, let's go ahead and click **No, use current settings**.

Then, a text box appears at the bottom of the page. 

Now, go ahead and copy and page the following JSON document into the text box:

	{ 
	    "TableName": "StaticHostingSample"
	}

![](img/MappingTemplateBodyAnon.png)

Then, click **Save**.

Then, click the back button next to **Method Execution** at the top of the page.

![](img/APIGatewayBackButtonAnon.png)

### Step 7. Test Method in API Gateway

Now, click **Test** at the top left of the diagram.

![](img/GetMethodExecutionAnon.png)

![](img/APIGatewayTestMethodAnon.png)

And there we have it, our dummy JSON document returned by API Gateway

![](img/APIGatewayTestMethodResultAnon.png)

### Step 8. Deploy your Method in API Gateway

Now, let's deploy the API. But first, we need to **enable CORS**. 

**Important:** Even though we did this before a bug in the API Gateway console forces us to enable CORS before every deployment of our API.

Select the **GET** Resource and then click **Enable CORS**:

![](img/EnableCORSAnon.png)

Then, click **Enable CORS and replace existing CORS headers**.

![](img/EnableCORS2Anon.png)

then, another popup will appear. Go ahead and click **Yes, replace existing values**.

![](img/ConfirmCORSChangesAnon.png)

![](img/CORSEnabledAnon.png)

Now, we are ready to actually deploy the API.

Make sure you select the ``GET`` resource at the left, and the select **Deploy API** from the **Actions** drop down list:

![](img/DeployAPIAnon.png)

![](img/DeployAPINewStageAnon.png)

If you haven't deployed this API before select **New Stage** from the **Deployment Stage** drop down list. Otherwise select ``DEV`` from the **Deployment Stage** drop down list.

When creating a new stage, enter ``DEV`` as your **Stage name** and provide a description for **Stage description**:

![](img/DeployAPINewStage2Anon.png)

Then, click **Deploy**.

![](img/APIDeployedAnon.png)

Then, at the top of our **DEV Stage Editor** page we can find our endpoint URL which we can use in our client.

Take note of the endpoint base URL at the top, for instance:

	https://sbs594dei.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV

This means our endpoint URL is going to be

	https://sbs594dei.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV/getdatabaseitem

### Step 9. Test API with cURL or Postman

Now open a CMD or bash window in type the following command:

	curl https://sbs594dei.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV/getdatabaseitem

This should result in an output like this:

	{"Count":1,"Items":[{"Id":{"S":"5d1cf7f9c8a7237ccecbaf55"},"Name":{"S":"Leblanc Mckee"}}],"ScannedCount":1}


### Step 10. Secure your API endpoint

Up to this point your API isn't secured and anyone that knows the URL can see your data.

Now, assuming you have set up a Cognito User pool for your application and organization before, go ahead a click **Authorizers** from the left menu.

![](img/APIGatewayAuthorizersAnon.png)

Then, click **Create New Authorizer**.

![](img/CreateNewAuthorizerAnon.png) 

![](img/CreateAuthorizerAnon.png) 

Then, provide a **Name** for the Authorizer, such as ``StaticHostingSampleAuthorizer``.

Then, select **Cognito** as **Type**.

Then, enter the name of your **Cognito User Pool**. Make sure you select the correct region if your Cognito User Pool is hosted in another region from your API Gateway. 

**Note:** if the **Cognito User Pool** drop down list does not populate, make sure you created a **Cognito User Pool**.

Then, enter ``Authorization`` as **Token Source**. 

Then, click **Create**.

![](img/AuthorizersAnon.png)

Now, let's go back to the API, by clicking **Resources** from the left menu, and select the ``GET`` Resource.

![](img/MethodRequestAnon.png)

Then, click **Method Request**.

And, select **StaticHostingSampleAuthorizer** from the **Authorization** drop down list. Then click the little check icon. 

![](img/APIGatewayMethodRequestAuthorizationAnon.png)

Now, re-deploy your API:


**Important:** Even though we did this before a bug in the API Gateway console forces us to enable CORS before every deployment of our API.

Select the **GET** Resource and then click **Enable CORS**:

![](img/EnableCORSAnon.png)

Then, click **Enable CORS and replace existing CORS headers**.

![](img/EnableCORS2Anon.png)

then, another popup will appear. Go ahead and click **Yes, replace existing values**.

![](img/ConfirmCORSChangesAnon.png)

![](img/CORSEnabledAnon.png)

Now, we are ready to actually deploy the API.

Make sure you select the ``GET`` resource at the left, and the select **Deploy API** from the **Actions** drop down list:

![](img/DeployAPIAnon.png)

![](img/DeployAPINewStageAnon.png)

If you haven't deployed this API before select **New Stage** from the **Deployment Stage** drop down list. Otherwise select ``DEV`` from the **Deployment Stage** drop down list.

When creating a new stage, enter ``DEV`` as your **Stage name** and provide a description for **Stage description**:

![](img/DeployAPINewStage2Anon.png)

Then, click **Deploy**.

![](img/APIDeployedAnon.png)


At this point, the cURL command or Postman call you executed earlier should fail because of a missing Authorization token:

	curl https://sbs594dei.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV/getdatabaseitem

	{"message":"Unauthorized"}

From now on, after integrating your web application with Cognito you will need to include a Cognito Authorization Token when calling your ``/getdatabaseitem`` API endpoint.

## Conclusion

In this lab we showed you how you can communicate directly to DynamoDB from client-side script in a static hosted website, without the use of Lambda.
